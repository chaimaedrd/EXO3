We have created a PHP script that will allow us to extract and use the data contained in several text files. The names of these files correspond to dates (example: 21-04-2022.txt).
Let's suppose that the data in each file corresponding to the list of students was absent on the date specified in the file name.
1. Write a script to read all the files whose name is between the dates: 01-03-2022 and 21-04-2022.
2. Create an associative table in which you put for each student how many times was absent during the period of: 01-03-2022 and 21-04-2022 then display it.
